                    I began my coding journey in college. I then used my base knowledge of Excel and SQL to help me succeed as a supply chain analyst during a 5-year professional career, but was hungry to learn more. From there, I studied Python and JavaScript in my free time before deciding I wanted to futher my education by taking a full-stack bootcamp through the University of Utah. I completed a full-stack bootcamp in January 2022.
