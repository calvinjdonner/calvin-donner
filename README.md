# Calvin Donner Portfolio

## Purpose
Introduces me to prospective employers and fellow coders. It contains the following sections:
* About me - a brief description to introduce myself and provide an overview of my coding journey thus far
* Portfolio - a section with clickable links of projects that I have/am currently working on
* Resume - a link that will open a PDF of my resume in another window. This will allow hiring managers and HR members access to my resume in a quick fashion
* Contact - this section provides my email and phone number as well as an opportunity for others to provide their name, phone number, email, and a brief message

In the hero, I included my professional photo, which is the same for my GitHub and LinkedIn pages. I also included clickable links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles via the social icons. They are in both the hero and contact sections of the page.
